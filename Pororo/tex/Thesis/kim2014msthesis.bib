While much progress has been made in recent years with efforts on sharing code and datasets, it is of great importance to develop a library and benchmark to gauge the state of the art. After briefly reviewing recent advances of online object tracking, we carry out large scale experiments with various evaluation criteria to understand how these algorithms perform. The test image sequences are annotated with different attributes for performance evaluation and analysis. By analyzing quantitative results, we identify effective approaches for robust tracking and provide potential future research directions in this field.},

@article{Tatler2011,
abstract = {Models of gaze allocation in complex scenes are derived mainly from studies of static picture viewing. The dominant framework to emerge has been image salience, where properties of the stimulus play a crucial role in guiding the eyes. However, salience-based schemes are poor at accounting for many aspects of picture viewing and can fail dramatically in the context of natural task performance. These failures have led to the development of new models of gaze allocation in scene viewing that address a number of these issues. However, models based on the picture-viewing paradigm are unlikely to generalize to a broader range of experimental contexts, because the stimulus context is limited, and the dynamic, task-driven nature of vision is not represented. We argue that there is a need to move away from this class of model and find the principles that govern gaze allocation in a broader range of settings. We outline the major limitations of salience-based selection schemes and highlight what we have learned from studies of gaze allocation in natural vision. Clear principles of selection are found across many instances of natural vision and these are not the principles that might be expected from picture-viewing studies. We discuss the emerging theoretical framework for gaze allocation on the basis of reward maximization and uncertainty reduction.},

@article{Bouma1973,
abstract = {As part of a visual investigation of reading processes, single words have been recognized in parafoveal vision. Correct initial and final letters are counted in the response words. Surprisingly, the most outward letters, far from fixation, score higher than the most inward letters, close to fixation. The same result is obtained if these letters are directly recognized from unpronounceable letter strings. This reveals a strong adverse interaction mainly acting towards the fovea. Words and inward letters are recognized better Right than Left of fixation, in particular for long stimuli. Therefore the range of interaction seems smaller Right than Left of fixation possibly due to reading habits. Letter counts are higher in words than in letter strings. The difference gives the completion by other perceived word properties. Au cours d'une recherche visuelle sur les processus de lecture, on a\'{e}tudi\'{e}la reconnaissance de mots s\'{e}par\'{e}s en vision parafov\'{e}ale. On compte les lettres initiales et finales correctes dans les mots pr\'{e}sent\'{e}s. Il est surprenant que les lettres les plus\'{e}loign\'{e}es du point de fixation aient un meilleur score que les plus rapproch\'{e}es. On obtient le meˆme r\'{e}sultat si ces lettres sont reconnues directement dans des suites de lettres non pronon\c{c}ables. Ceci r\'{e}v\`{e}le une forte interaction adverse agissant surtout vers la fov\'{e}a. Les mots et lettres internes sont mieux reconnus du coˆt\'{e}droit que du gauche de la fixation, surtout pour des mots longs. La port\'{e}e de l'interaction semble donc plus petite\`{a}droite qu'\`{a}gauche, peut-\^{e}tre\`{a}cause des habitudes de lecture. Les lettres sont mieux reconnues dans des mots que dans des suites de lettres. La diff\'{e}rence provient d'autres propri\'{e}t\'{e}s per\c{c}ues du mot. Als Teil einer optischen Untersuchung des Leseprozesses wurde die Aufgabe gestellt, einzelne Worte im parafovealeen Sehen zu erkennen. Die Anzahl der richtig gelesenen Anfangs- und Endbuchstaben wurde gez\"{a}hlt.\"{U}berraschenderweise lag die Zahl der richtig gelesenen Buchstaben bei grosser Entfernung vom Fixierpunkt h\"{o}her als in unmittelbarer N\"{a}he des Fixierpunktes. Das gleiche Ergebnis erhielt man bei unaussprechbaren Buchstabenfolgen. Dies weist auf eine stark hemmende Wechselwirkung hin, die haupts\"{a}chlich in Richtung auf die Fovea stattfindet. Worte und innenliegende Buchstaben werden besser rechts als links vom Fixierpunkt erkannt; dies trifft speziell f\"{u}r lange Buchstabenfolgen zu. Deshalb scheint der Bereich der Wechselwirkung rechts vom Fixierpunkt kleiner zu Scin als links, wobei m\"{o}glicherweise Lesegewohnheiten eine Rolle spielen. Die Anzahl der richtigen Antworten ist bei Worten grosser als bei einfachen Buchstabenfolgen. Der Unterschied wird durch die anderen wahrgenommenen Wortteile hervorgerufen.

Monitoring eye movements using video cameras has the advantage of being nonintrusive, inexpensive, and automated. The main objective of this paper is to propose an efficient approach for real-time eye feature tracking from a sequence of eye images. To this end, first the authors formulate a dynamic model for eye feature tracking, which relates the measurements from the eye images to the tracking parameters. In the model, the center of the iris is chosen as the tracking parameter vector and the gray level centroid of the eye is chosen as the measurement vector. In the authors' procedure for evaluating the gray level centroid, the preprocessing step such as edge detection and curve fitting need to be performed only for the first frame of the image sequence. A discrete Kalman filter is then constructed for the recursive estimation of the eye features, while taking into account the measurement noise. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy aspects and the real-time applicability of the proposed approach},

The primary obstacle of integrating eye movements into todays interfaces is the availability of a reliable, low-cost open-source eye-tracking system. Towards making such a system available to interface designers, we have developed a hybrid eye-tracking algorithm that integrates feature-based and model-based approaches and made it available in an open-source package. We refer to this algorithm as "starburst" because of the novel way in which pupil features are detected. This starburst algorithm is more accurate than pure feature-based approaches yet is signi?cantly less time consuming than pure modelbased approaches. The current implementation is tailored to tracking eye movements in infrared video obtained from an inexpensive head-mounted eye-tracking system. A validation study was conducted and showed that the technique can reliably estimate eye position with an accuracy of approximately one degree of visual angle.},

Although he views the trajectory for little more than half a second, he can accurately judge where and when the ball will reach him. Batsmen's eye movements monitor the moment when the ball is released, make a predictive saccade to the place where they expect it to hit the ground, wait for it to bounce, and follow its trajectory for 100-200 ms after the bounce. We show how information provided by these fixations may allow precise prediction of the ball's timing and placement. Comparing players with different skill levels, we found that a short latency for the first saccade distinguished good from poor batsmen, and that a cricket player's eye movement strategy contributes to his skill in the game.},

abstract = {The E-Z Reader model (Reichle et al. 1998; 1999) provides a theoretical framework for understanding how word identification, visual processing, attention, and oculomotor control jointly determine when and where the eyes move during reading. In this article, we first review what is known about eye movements during reading. Then we provide an updated version of the model (E-Z Reader 7) and describe how it accounts for basic findings about eye movement control in reading. We then review several alternative models of eye movement control in reading, discussing both their core assumptions and their theoretical scope. On the basis of this discussion, we conclude that E-Z Reader provides the most comprehensive account of eye movement control during reading. Finally, we provide a brief overview of what is known about the neural systems that support the various components of reading, and suggest how the cognitive constructs of our model might map onto this neural architecture. © 2003 Cambridge University Press.},

The major goal of the modeling is to relate cognitive processing (specifically aspects of lexical access) to eye movements in reading. The earliest and simplest versions of the model (E-Z Readers 1 and 2) merely attempt to explain the total time spent on a word before moving forward (the gaze duration) and the probability of fixating a word; later versions (E-Z Readers 3-5) also attempt to explain the durations of individual fixations on individual words and the number of fixations on individual words. The final version (E-Z Reader 5) appears to be psychologically plausible and gives a good account of many phenomena in reading. It is also a good tool for analyzing eye movement data in reading. Limitations of the model and directions for future research are also discussed.},

abstract = {Liechty, Pieters \& Wedel (2003) developed a hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify the states of an attentional process in an advertisement viewing task. This work is significant because it demonstrates the benefits of stochastic modeling and Bayesian estimation in making inferences about cognitive processes based on eye movement data. One limitation of the proposed approach is that attention is conceptualized as an autonomous random process that is affected neither by the overall layout of the stimulus nor by the visual information perceived during the current fixation. An alternative model based on the input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM; Bengio, 1999) is suggested as an extension of the HMM. The need for further studies that validate the HMM classification results is also discussed.},

abstract = {Random variables and probabilistic decision making are important elements in most theories of reading eye movements, but they tend to receive little theoretical attention. This paper attempts to address this problem by introducing the Stochastic, Hierarchical Architecture for Reading Eye-movements (SHARE). The SHARE framework formalizes reading eye movements as observable outcomes of a latent stochastic process. By modeling eye movements as time-series random variables, the goal of the model is to uncover statistical regularities in the data, which help to identify conditions and constraints the underlying mechanism must satisfy. In the univariate analysis, it is shown that a 3-component Lognormal mixture model provides a good fit to the marginal distribution function of fixation duration, and a hierarchical model is required for modeling saccade length. As a comprehensive model of reading eye movements, SHARE was implemented as an Input-Output Hidden Markov model. With a few simple hypotheses, SHARE is able to capture reading eye-movement patterns of beginning readers and proficient adults, and to reproduce well-known psycholinguistic effects. The rationale of the model, its relations with other modeling endeavors, and its implications are discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

They propose new procedures for the estimation of model parameters and for the test of the model's performance. They also present a mathematical analysis of the dynamics of the SWIFT model.

abstract ={Positron emission tomography of cerebral glucose metabolism in adult human subjects was used to investigate amygdaloid complex (AC) activity associated with the storage of long-term memory for emotionally arousing events. Subjects viewed two videos (one in each of two separate positron emission tomography sessions, separated by 3-7 days) consisting either of 12 emotionally arousing film clips ("E" film session) or of 12 relatively emotionally neutral film clips ("N" film session), and rated their emotional reaction to each film clip immediately after viewing it. Three weeks after the second session, memory for the videos was assessed in a free recall test. As expected, the subjects' average emotional reaction to the E films was higher than that for the N films. In addition, the subjects recalled significantly more E films than N films. Glucose metabolic rate of the right AC while viewing the E films was highly correlated with the number of E films recalled. AC activity was not significantly correlated with the number of N films recalled. The findings support the view derived from both animal and human investigations that the AC is selectively involved with the formation of enhanced long-term memory associated with emotionally arousing events.},

Extensive research in animals implicates stress hormones and the amygdaloid complex as key, interacting modulators of memory consolidation for emotional events. Considerable evidence suggests that the amygdala is not a site of long-term explicit or declarative memory storage, but serves to influence memory-storage processes in other brain regions, such as the hippocampus, striatum and neocortex. Human-subject studies confirm the prediction of animal work that the amygdala is involved with the formation of enhanced declarative memory for emotionally arousing events. "

But how can we attend to objects before they are recognized? In coherence theory of visual cognition, so-called proto-objects form volatile units of visual information that can be accessed by selective attention and subsequently validated as actual objects. We propose a biologically plausible model of forming and attending to proto-objects in natural scenes. We demonstrate that the suggested model can enable a model of object recognition in cortex to expand from recognizing individual objects in isolation to sequentially recognizing all objects in a more complex scene.},

In recent years, the firing patterns of single neurons have been interpreted using this framework. Here, we review evidence showing that the expression of salience is remarkably similar across structures, remarkably different across tasks, and modified in important ways when the salient object is consistent with the goals of the participant. These observations have important ramifications for theories of attention. We conclude that priority ? the combined representation of salience and relevance ? best describes the firing properties of neurons.},
